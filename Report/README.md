> **Personalized Medication Recommendation System**

---

## 1. Project Overview and Goals
The **Personalized Medication Recommendation System** is an AI-driven pipeline designed to ingest, preprocess, and analyze large-scale prescription and patient datasets to generate tailored drug recommendations. Our aims are to:

1. **Ingest & Preprocess**: Clean and consolidate heterogeneous datasets (patient records, prescription logs, drug interactions).  
2. **Feature Engineering & Selection**: Create and select high-impact features (sentiment scores, interaction counts, average ratings).  
3. **Modeling**: Train and evaluate multiple classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) using stratified sampling and reproducible splits.  
4. **Interpretation**: Visualize model outputs and feature importances via SHAP and correlation analyses.  
5. **Deployment**: Deliver an interactive Streamlit dashboard for clinicians to explore and validate recommendations.

## 2. Milestone 2 Highlights (Feature Engineering & Modeling)

During **Milestone 2**, we focused on advanced data transformations and baseline model evaluation:

- **Custom Features**:  
  - Average Drug Rating (per drug)  
  - Sentiment Score (TextBlob polarity on patient reviews)  
  - Review Length & Complexity metrics  
  - Drug Interaction Count aggregated from interaction database  

- **Encoding Strategies**:  
  - Label Encoding for ordinal severity levels  
  - One-Hot Encoding for nominal fields (drug class, manufacturer, condition)  

- **Feature Selection**:  
  - Impurity-based importances from Random Forest  
  - Correlation matrix to detect multicollinearity  

- **Model Training**:  
  - 80:20 stratified train-test split with fixed random seed  
  - Evaluated Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, XGBoost  
  - Key metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC  
  - **Results**: Random Forest achieved highest F1 and AUC; XGBoost closely matched; SVM and Logistic Regression showed trade-offs between precision and recall

## 3. Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, TextBlob, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP

## Setup Instructions

This project helps recommend the right medicine using a smart machine learning model. To see how it works, we’ve made a simple dashboard you can run right from your computer (or Google Colab). Just follow the steps below.

---

###  What You Need First (Before We Begin)

Make sure you have these ready:

- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- **pip** (Python’s package installer)
- **Git** (optional — helps you download the project quickly)

If you're using **Google Colab**, don’t worry — you don’t need to install Python. We’ll give you a simple way to run it there too!

---

###  Step 1: Get the Project Files

#### Option 1: Using Git (Fastest)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjanakodavali/cap5771sp25-project.git
```

#### Option 2: Manual Download

1. Go to the GitHub page for this project  
2. Click the green **"Code"** button  
3. Choose **Download ZIP**  
4. Unzip it and open the folder in VS Code or any editor

---

###  Step 2: Install the Tools (Dependencies)

#### If You're on a Computer (Local Setup)

1. Open a terminal in the project folder  
2. Run this to create a private workspace:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the environment:

- **Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- **Mac/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install all necessary tools:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

####  If You're Using Google Colab

Just copy and run this in a code cell:

```python
!pip install streamlit shap scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib plotly joblib
```

Note: You can't launch the full dashboard inside Colab, but you can test the models and SHAP visualizations.

---

### Step 3: Run the Dashboard

If you're on your computer, run this to open the dashboard in your browser:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

You'll see:

-  Model scores like Accuracy and F1
-  ROC and PR curves
-  Top features influencing predictions
-  SHAP plots to explain decisions
